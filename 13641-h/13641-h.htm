    <h3>FINANCIAL&mdash;THE DEBT.</h3>
    <p>Our receipts for the eleven months ending August 31st show an increase from
    collections of $14,452.76; a decrease in legacies of $5,195.52; with a net increase
    of $9,257.24 over the corresponding months of last year. On the other hand, the
    expenditures for these eleven months have been $31,835.70 more than those of last
    year, and hence a debt of over $22,000 is impending. The explanation is to be found
    in the fact that an unusually large per cent. of our collections this year is in
    specified gifts for special objects, and could not, therefore, be used to meet
    appropriations for current work; and the added expenditures have been absolutely
    required by the natural and healthful growth in our varied industrial, school and
    church work in all parts of our extended field.</p>
    <p>As our friends have had occasion to know, we are making an earnest appeal for
    special help to avert this threatened debt. The responses thus far are encouraging,
    but not such as to leave the question beyond doubt. This magazine will reach most of
    our readers before the last Sunday of the month. <i>We urgently appeal to our friends
    to make a grand rally on that day for our relief</i>.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>
    <p>The forty-second Annual Meeting of the American Missionary Association will be
    held at Providence, R.I., Oct. 23-25. The meeting will open promptly at 3 o'clock,
    Tuesday P.M., Oct. 23. On Tuesday evening, the annual sermon will be preached by Rev.
    Arthur Little, D.D., of Chicago. Those purposing to be present and wishing
    entertainment are requested to write to Mr. G.E. Luther, Secretary of Committee of
    Entertainment, Providence, R.I. (See the last page of the cover.)</p>
    <a name="page268" id="page268"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 268]</span>
    <hr />
    <h3>VOTING MEMBERS.</h3>
    <p>By our Constitution it will be observed that the following persons are entitled to
    vote at the annual meetings of this Association: Members of evangelical churches who
    have been constituted life members by the payment of $30 into its treasury, with the
    written declaration at the time or times of payment that the sum is to be applied to
    constitute a designated person a life member, such membership beginning sixty days
    after the payment; delegates chosen to attend the annual meeting by evangelical
    churches which have within a year contributed to the funds of the Association, such
    churches being entitled to send two delegates each. Each State Conference or
    Association is also entitled to send two delegates. Such delegates are members of the
    Association for the year for which they were appointed.</p>
    <p>We sincerely urge our patrons to avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded
    to participate in the management of the trusts of this Association, hoping that by so
    doing they will share more fully in the responsibility of its work and become more
    helpful in furthering its development in years to come.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>We are happy to announce the return of Rev. Dr. Beard. He attended the London
    Missionary Conference, as the delegate of the American Missionary Association, and
    presented a paper on "History of Missions among the North American Indians." He was
    called by a telegram to Florence to the sick bed of two of his children, one of them
    very severely ill. Both recovered and he now returns to America, himself and family
    in excellent health. During his absence, he preached in his former pulpit in the
    American Church in Paris, and met many of his former parishioners. He had become
    greatly attached to that church and much interested in the very successful McAll
    Mission, to which he was greatly helpful. We welcome him once more to his chosen
    field in the work of the A.M.A., where he will find ample room for the exertion of
    his best energies.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The executive committee of the American Missionary Association has unanimously
    appointed the Rev. Frank E. Jenkins a Field Superintendent, to examine and report
    upon the work of our schools and churches in our Southern field. Mr. Jenkins is a
    graduate of Williams College, Massachusetts, and has had some years' experience as a
    principal of advanced schools. He is a graduate of Hartford Theological Seminary, and
    has been engaged successfully in our work in the South. Some parts of the field are
    already well known to him, and with others he will make immediate acquaintance. We
    commend him to our missionary teachers and preachers in the field, as a beloved
    Christian brother whose heart is in full sympathy with our work. <span
    class="newpage"><a name="page2697" id="page2697"></a>[pg 269]</span> We trust that
    the relationships which will be established, will be fruitful in helpfulness. His
    residence will be in Chattanooga, Tenn.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The prevalence of yellow fever at Jacksonville, Fla., and the danger of its
    spreading into the towns and cities of the southeast, will make it wise for us to
    delay for a time the opening of a few of our schools in that region. In former years
    some of our teachers, while at their posts, were caught by this malignant scourge and
    they faced the danger bravely&mdash;some of them laying down their lives and others
    permanently impairing their healths, by taking care of the smitten ones. Such heroism
    is demanded when the danger comes, but it does not seem best to seek the danger. A
    little delay in some places, we hope, will be all that is necessary.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>By the time these pages reach our readers, most of our workers will have resumed
    their labors in the South. Many of the ministers and a few of the teachers have
    remained at their posts all summer, but the schools have been closed. Work in the
    cotton fields has called for the younger pupils, the summer schools have given
    employment to the older ones, while rest and a change of climate have been required
    by the white teachers from the North. But now activities will be resumed, and we
    contemplate the work with joy and hope.</p>
    <p>These workers, and others like them, are the hope of the South. They go not
    arrayed and armed for bloody battle-fields; they go not as commercial travelers to
    sell the wares of the North; they go not as capitalists to start the whirling
    spindles or to kindle the fires in the smelting furnaces; they go not as politicians
    to speak for or against tariffs, nor to build up or break down parties. Their work is
    quieter and deeper than all this. They reach the mind and heart. As Christ aimed not
    so much at once to tear down or build up the outer, but to reach the inner springs of
    the soul, so these workers aim to <i>make character</i>, intelligent, pure, active,
    and thus to impel to all that is noble and honest in life, that stimulates to
    industry, economy, thrift&mdash;to making the home pure and all outer things
    prosperous and right. But, as Christ was misunderstood and rejected, so are these
    laborers ostracized. We rejoice to find a growing recognition of their worth and
    work, and trust that the day is coming when they will be fully appreciated and
    welcomed. In the meantime they toil on uncomplainingly, and for their sakes and for
    the work's sake we invoke, not perfunctorily but earnestly, the prayers of God's
    ministers and people in their behalf.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>On another page will be found a review of two books by the well-known author,
    Edmund Kirke (J.R. Gilmore), who has made a special study of the white people of the
    Mountain regions of the South. Mr. Kirke has <a name="page270" id="page270"></a><span
    class="newpage">[pg 270]</span> at our invitation prepared a paper to be read at our
    Annual Meeting, in connection with the Report on our Mountain Work. We have been
    permitted to read it. It is replete with racy incidents and delineations of quaint
    yet noble characters. If the tears and smiles which the reading of the paper drew
    from us are any test, then we can promise a treat to those who may hear it at the
    meeting in Providence.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES FOR MISSION WORK.</h3>
    <p>Many of our missionaries who are engaged in their devoted and self-denying labors
    in the South, have been compelled by the nature of our work to take their summer
    vacations. The educational work of the American Missionary Association is through and
    through a missionary work. It is begun with a missionary purpose and is carried on in
    the name of Christ to disciple the people, that they may know Him who is the Way, the
    Truth and the Life. All of our teachers are sent to be missionaries. Many are
    returning now to their fields of service with which they are well acquainted, and
    some are going for the first time. Among these, questions are raised as to the
    requirements needed in those who are to go. We have thought that a few suggestions
    given to the candidates for the China Inland Mission by Hudson Taylor, might be
    properly repeated here for those who are to take upon themselves these responsible
    Christian duties. He says:</p>
    <blockquote><p>First of all, it is absolutely essential that those desiring to be missionaries
    should have a deep love for Christ, a full grasp of His plan of salvation, and be
    wholly consecrated, in their inward lives, to Him. Mission work is not preaching
    grand sermons, or witnessing marvellous baptisms; it is a patient Christ-like life,
    day by day, far from external help, far from those we love; a quiet sowing of tiny
    seeds, which may take long years to show above the ground, combined with a steady
    bearing of loneliness, discomfort and petty persecution. The work demands of every
    worker very real and manifest self-sacrifice and acts of faith. It aims at, and ought
    to be satisfied with, nothing less than the <i>conversion</i> of the people to God.
    Not <i>witness</i>-bearing merely, but <i>fruit</i>-bearing is the end in view.
    Anything short of the salvation of souls is failure.</p>
    <p>It is generally found that when people are of no use at home, they are of no use
    in the mission field. The bright, brave, earnest spirit, ready to face difficulties
    at home, is the right spirit for the work abroad. A patient, persevering, plodding
    spirit, attempting great things for God, and expecting great things from God, is
    absolutely essential to success in missionary efforts. Those will not make the best
    missionaries who are easily daunted by the first difficulty or opposition, but those
    whose strength is equal to waiting upon God, and who fight through all obstacles by
    prayer and faith. The spasmodic worker, frantic in zeal one month, and at
    freezing-point another, will be weary long before the station has been reached: while
    in the strength of Christ the weakest of us need not draw back, nor say, "I am not
    fit," yet nothing less than burning love to Christ, and in Him to perishing souls,
    will survive and overleap the difficulties and disappointments of the work.</p></blockquote>
    <p>These are royal words, and we believe that our teachers and missionaries engaged
    in this most glorious work of saving needy souls will take with them this spirit, and
    be blessed in the communication of their blessing to others.</p>

    <h3>IMMIGRANTS AND NEGROES.</h3>
    <p>The <i>Immigrant</i> question challenges attention. Shall immigrants be welcomed,
    restricted or prohibited? In the early days of the Republic, when the revolutionary
    war had welded the people together and our boundless territory begged for occupancy,
    we welcomed the oppressed of all nations. Later, the welcome has been responded to by
    such a rushing, heterogeneous and even dangerous mass that we are compelled to pause.
    Restriction is talked of, but the line of discrimination is hard to be fixed. No
    committee at Castle Garden can detect anarchists, criminals, or even the poor, if
    that line should be chosen. Prohibition&mdash;exclusion is talked of&mdash;nay, is
    enacted stringently against the Chinese. If need be, it may extend to all. So there
    <i>is</i> a way of averting this evil.</p>
    <p>But the <i>Negro</i> question cannot be put away. The Negroes are here. They
    outnumber the immigrants that have come to our shores in the last thirty years, and
    have a foothold upon the soil as valid as the Aryan race, whether we consider the
    date of their coming or the labor they have put upon the land.</p>
    <p>There is a strange disposition to shrink from the Negro question. Some avoid it by
    flippantly denying the danger; others turn from it because they are appalled by it.
    Thus an able writer on Immigration in a recent number of the <i>Century</i> passes
    the topic with this awe-stricken remark: "This problem (of the Negro) cannot be
    touched practically; ancient wrongs bind the nation hand and foot, and its outcome
    must be awaited as we await the gathering of the tempest&mdash;<i>powerless to avert,
    and trembling over the steady approach</i>" (The italics are ours.) This is not wise;
    it is not manly. Why try to avert the evils of immigration, or any other, if we are
    meanwhile only to await tremblingly the doom that is to come on us from the conflict
    with the Negro?</p>
    <p>There is a strong disposition to gather hope from the newly-developed
    manufacturing interests in the South. But this is delusive. The South is essentially
    a rural population; the new industries will necessarily be confined to a few
    localities, and will reach but slightly the wide agricultural region, and will
    scarcely touch the Negroes. And more than all this, these industries will only be
    importing into the South the struggle between labor and capital, which so vexes us at
    the North. Instead, therefore, of solving the old difficulties at the South, they
    will add a new one.</p>
    <p>The danger of a war of races is scouted at the North; it is not at the South. This
    is natural. The North is not in immediate contact with the danger; the South is. When
    the war of the rebellion was impending, the North refused to believe in its coming;
    and when it came, one of the wisest statesmen of the North, Mr. Seward, predicted
    that it would "not last sixty days." No such delusion prevailed in the South. Many of
    the best men there, nay, nearly all the border States, dreaded its coming and held
    back as <a name="page272" id="page272"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 272]</span> long
    as possible, but they were swept into the flood they foresaw and could not avert.</p>
    <p>Thoughtful men at the South now have no rose-colored views about the Negro
    problem. They fear the impending conflict. With them the supremacy of the white race
    is the settled point, but they see in the growing numbers, intelligence and
    restlessness of the Negroes an increasing danger that will only be aggravated by
    delay. Why should not the North and South alike manfully face the question of a war
    of races? What will it mean? What will be its end? If the whites and the blacks of
    the South alone engage in it, the blacks will be exterminated. Nothing less will meet
    the case. If the North mingle in the struggle, it must be to help the whites or the
    blacks. If to help the whites, that will mean the more rapid defeat and slaughter of
    the blacks; if the North help the blacks and save them from destruction, then we
    shall be worse off than we are now, the two races will be together with enmities
    aroused a thousand fold!</p>
    <p>But why not face the more hopeful question: Is there a remedy? There is! The
    teacher and the preacher, the spelling-book and the Bible, the saviours of men, the
    reformers of society, the uplifters of races, are spreading over the South. They go
    to the manufacturing towns&mdash;the Birminghams and the Annistons&mdash;they go to
    the large cities with their common and normal schools, their medical, law and
    theological seminaries. When the pupils become teachers, they go into the smaller
    towns, they go into the rural districts, on the small farms, everywhere instructing,
    encouraging and stimulating the people, leading them to more intelligent industries,
    to economy, to the purchase of land, the erection of better houses, to a higher aim
    in life, and to the formation of a right character. Of such stuff men are made,
    citizens, Christians; men who can use the ballot, who own property that must be
    protected by the ballot; men who have homes that must be refined and pure, churches
    where God is worshipped intelligently and where a practical morality is taught and
    attained. Such a people will be safe, for they will be bone and muscle of the South,
    they will be needed in its wide expanse of fertile soil, needed in its practical
    trades, needed for the accumulated wealth, intelligence and cultivated piety they
    will bring into all the walks and avocations of life.</p>
    <p>But it will be some time before these educational and religious means reach all
    the blacks, and in the meantime much patience and toil will be needed. To the blacks
    we would say: You won the admiration of men and the blessing of God by your patience
    under the yoke of slavery when there seemed to be no hope; now win both again by
    bearing in like spirit your lesser present ills, while hope dawns and help is
    near.</p>
    <p>To thoughtful men North and South we urge: Take hold of this work like men. If a
    thousandth part of the self-sacrifice and money spent in the war were devoted to this
    work, the evil might be averted. Why stand over-awed at a threatened flood that if
    met in time may not only be averted but be turned into fertilizing waters over the
    broad lands?</p>

    <h3>BOOK REVIEW.</h3>
    <p><b>THE REAR GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION.</b> By JAMES R. GILMORE (Edmund Kirke). D.
    Appleton &amp; Co.: New York. 1.50.</p>
    <p><b>JOHN SEVIER AS A COMMONWEALTH BUILDER.</b> By JAMES R. GILMORE (Edmund Kirke).
    D. Appleton &amp; Co.: New York. 1.50.</p>
    <p>Just one hundred years before the rebellion of the Southern States, Daniel Boone
    cut on a beech tree near Jonesboro, Tenn., the following words, which are still
    legible:</p>
<pre>
        D. Boon
Cilled    A BAR     on
           THE     Tree
in        YEAR  1760
</pre>
    <p>The same year that Daniel Boone "cilled" (killed) this "bar," William Bean, a
    former companion of Boone's, settled in the valley of the Watauga River, in what is
    now Eastern Tennessee. The two volumes whose titles are given above trace the history
    of this mountain settlement from the time that this pioneer crossed the Alleghenies
    down to the death of John Sevier, Sept. 24, 1815. These books are of much more than
    ordinary interest to the readers of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY. James R. Gilmore (Edmund
    Kirke) has put the same power of graphic description, the simple yet thrilling
    narrative, which held us spell-bound to the last chapters of <i>Among the
    Pines</i>.</p>
    <p>Our limited space does not permit an extended review of these volumes. We only
    call attention to them here because they touch upon great missionary problems, and
    throw a flood of light upon these interesting Mountain people among whom the A.M.A.
    has so extensive and important a work. The first of these volumes in chronological
    order is the <i>Rear Guard of the Revolution</i>. The colony of the Mountain people
    in the Watauga Valley, led by John Sevier and James Robertson and Isaac Shelby,
    constituted this "rear guard." No better blood ever mingled in the veins of a people
    than that which flows in this Mountain people. French Huguenot, Scotch-Irish
    Presbyterian and Welsh Presbyterian were their ancestors. With such leadership as
    these three men furnished, the early Mountain colonists ought to have been heroes,
    and they were.</p>
    <p>In the author's own words, "These three men, John Sevier, James Robertson and
    Isaac Shelby, * * * were like Washington and Lincoln, 'providential men.' They
    marched neither to the sound of drum nor bugle, and no flaming bulletins proclaimed
    their exploits in the ears of a listening continent; their slender forces trod
    silently the western solitudes, and their greatest battles were insignificant
    skirmishes never reported beyond the mountains; but their deeds were pregnant with
    consequences that will be felt along the coming centuries."</p>
    <p>They were, and they held themselves to be, "providential men." Whether reading the
    Bible by the light of the great pine fires, or burning the cabins <a name="page274"
    id="page274"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 274]</span> of the Cherokees, or driving
    the marauding Chickamaugas into their lair at "Nick-a-Jack" cave, or beating the
    British at King's Mountain, these men felt themselves called of God to maintain for
    the people a free government.</p>
    <p>There was the same reckless administration of punishment that still characterizes
    these Mountain people. A tory appeared in the road one day near the home of Colonel
    William Campbell, of the "Backwater settlement." The Colonel at once gives him chase;
    after a brief absence he returns to his home, and his wife eagerly asks "What did you
    do with him?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, we hung him, Betty, that's all."</p>
    <p>These early settlers did not immediately plant churches and school-houses, as the
    settlers of New England did. Still they were not altogether illiterate. A public
    document still in existence has the signature of 112 out of 114 of their number who
    signed the paper, <i>two</i> only making their X.</p>
    <p>In 1779, the first Court House was built at Jonesboro. At about the same date, the
    author informs us, "The school mistress was to be found at nearly every cross-road in
    the older settlements. She occupied a small log-house, generally about sixteen feet
    square, and often without floor or windows." The author might have added that she, or
    one like her, occupies the same school-house to-day.</p>
    <p>In 1779, the first "church-house" was erected, and Rev. Tidence Lane became the
    "first settled minister beyond the Alleghenies."</p>
    <p>To those of our readers who have recently followed the missionary work of the
    A.M.A. in this Mountain region, these books will be of great interest.</p>
    <p>CHAS. J. RYDER.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>We have received from Rev. Austin Willey, author of "THE HISTORY OF THE
    ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE IN THE STATE AND NATION," a gift of one hundred copies of the book
    for gratuitous distribution among our workers in the South. We gave a brief review
    and a warm commendation of the volume in the AMERICAN MISSIONARY for June, 1886, and
    we renew our endorsement, and tender our thanks to the author for his benefaction.
    Our field workers will be interested in this candid sketch of the early anti-slavery
    struggle, and we believe that many of our white friends in the South will be glad to
    read in the light of these quiet days the sayings and doings of a class of people
    whom they then misunderstood.</p>
    <p>The book may be had of B. Thurston, Portland, Me., or of C.T. Dillingham, 678
    Broadway, N.Y. Price, 1.50, postpaid.</p>
    <p>The reference to Father Willey and his book is suggestive. He is one of the "old,
    original" abolitionists. Men who were once denounced and are now scarcely honored,
    for lo! to the amazement and amusement of some of us, we find that everybody was an
    abolitionist and always had been, that everybody learned to hate slavery on the
    mother's lap, and was always opposed to it! We who in those early days were treated
    as outcasts by "gentlemen of property <a name="page275" id="page275"></a><span
    class="newpage">[pg 275]</span> and standing," and mobbed by the rabble at their
    bidding, are led to wonder what has become of all those who thus disagreed with us!
    One marked exception occurs to us. A prominent professor in a theological seminary,
    when the question was put to him ten years ago: "Professor, when did you become an
    Abolitionist?" replied, with a merry twinkle in his eye: "When it became popular." We
    have found few, however, who are so frank or so witty.</p>

    <h3>THE UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE OF OUR MISSIONARIES AT THE SOUTH.</h3>
    <p>In a recent number of <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, Sir William W. Hunter, an
    eminent authority, reporting the influence of the missionaries in India, says that
    among the people to whom they have gone they have built up the most complete
    confidence and implicit faith in the purity and unselfishness of their motives. He
    declares that he regards the missionary work of the English as an expiation for
    wrong-doing, and he believes that the missionary instinct forms the necessary
    spiritual complement of the aggressive genius of the English race. Sir William also
    claims that the advance of missionaries in the good opinion of non-Christian peoples
    is a most striking evidence of their high character and intelligence, and that no
    class of Englishmen has done so much to make England respected in India as the
    missionaries, that no class has done so much to awaken the Indian's intellect and to
    lessen the dangers of transition from the old state of things to the new.</p>
    <p>After this much of condensation of that profound article by the <i>Christian
    Union</i>, we quote from the author:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The careless onlooker may have no particular convictions on the subject, and
      flippant persons may ridicule religious effort in India as elsewhere. But I think
      that few Indian administrators have passed through high office, and had to deal
      with the ultimate problems of British government in that country, without feeling
      the value of the work done by missionaries. Such men gradually realize, as I have
      realized, that the missionaries do really represent the spiritual side of the new
      civilization, and of the new life which we are introducing into India."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Names and places being changed, it is coming to appear that the whole of this can
    be said of the Christian workers from the North among the colored people of the
    South. Besides all of their work that can be told by statistics, and besides all of
    that in building up character among the Negroes and awakening their intellect and
    their aspiration for thrift in every sense, they have exerted a profound unconscious
    influence upon the white people of that Southland. They, too, have built up among the
    whites a confidence in the purity and unselfishness of their motives. At first they
    were suspected as emissaries of a political party. By many even of the best people
    there they were held as necessarily persons of low-down condition and character to be
    willing to do that "low-down work." "With our views of the case, how <a
    name="page276" id="page276"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 276]</span> could we
    believe anything else?" was the answer to the remonstrance against the current mode
    of treatment. Gradually this feeling has been giving way to one of growing
    confidence, until for several years such men as Rev. Dr. A.G. Haygood and Mr. G.W.
    Cable, and such papers as the <i>Memphis Appeal</i>, and such a State Board of
    Examiners as that of the Atlanta University have been publicly declaring the high
    intellectual quality and moral standing of these once despised teachers, while many
    of the most respectable citizens are privately saying the same thing, and multitudes
    believe it, though making no announcement of the same.</p>
    <p>By this crucifixion of feeling through which those workers have passed, and by
    their self-denying endurance of hardness, they too, in no small sense, have been
    making expiation for the wrongs done the slaves. Their missionary instinct also forms
    the necessary spiritual complement of the aggressive genius of the Puritan
    civilization which is now taking possession where its sword had cleared the way.
    Their advance in the good opinion of the best people of the South is also a striking
    evidence of their high character and intelligence. No class of Northern people going
    South have done so much to make the North respected as the missionaries, and none are
    doing more to lessen the danger of transition from the old state of things to the
    new. Going, not as "carpet-baggers," but as citizens, to be identified with the moral
    reconstruction of the South, they translate there the real spirit of the North, and
    represent the spiritual side of the new life which is going into that fair portion of
    our own dear country. By the peculiar people to whom they especially go, and who
    prove to have a natural affinity for Puritan ideas and institutions, they are doing
    more than any others to set up, not a New England in the South, but a New South,
    wherein shall be rejuviant the principles of that civilization which was planted at
    Plymouth Rock.</p>

    <h3>EXPULSION OF NEGROES FROM MARION, ARKANSAS.</h3>
    <p>It is not our custom to publish details of alleged outrages upon the colored
    people at the South. We have no wish to stir up strife by recalling memories of the
    past, or by giving incidents of recent aggression against the helpless. But this case
    in Marion is free from bloody details and is a simple illustration of the
    determination of the white people to maintain their sway in the South.</p>
    <p>The simple facts in the case are, that in Crittenden County, Arkansas, of which
    Marion is the county town, the population is chiefly colored, the ratio being seven
    negroes to one white man. For several years the office of Judge of the County and
    Probate Court, and the Clerk and under officers of the court, were colored men. The
    more important county offices were held by white men. On a given day, fifty or more
    heavily-armed white men appeared at the county seat and drove from their offices and
    homes the colored officers named above, together with the colored local doctor, the
    <a name="page277" id="page277"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 277]</span> lawyer, the
    schoolmaster of the colored school, the editor of the colored newspaper and a number
    of other prominent colored citizens.</p>
    <p>The farther details of the transaction are given in a thoughtful and calm article
    in a recent number of <i>The Independent</i> by Rev. B.A. Imes, the colored minister
    of the church at Memphis, Tenn., under the care of this Association. We give below
    all of the article that relates to the facts:</p>
    <h4>THE CRITTENDEN COUNTY OUTRAGE.</h4>
    <center>
      BY THE REV. B.A. IMES.
    </center>
    <p>From the bluff at Memphis we look across the river, where along the western shore
    stretch the forests of Crittenden County, Arkansas, and Marion, about fourteen miles
    from Memphis, is the county-seat. The story of the recent banishment of fifteen
    prominent colored office-holders, professional men and farmers has gone to the
    world.</p>
    <p>The whites, well armed, took their game by surprise, bagged and shipped it without
    bloodshed. Now the "empire is peace" they say, although for a time terror reigned
    among the startled colored people.</p>
    <p>With a Negro population six or seven times as large as the white, it is not
    strange that the County Court Judge, the County Clerk and his deputy should be
    Negroes, nor that they should aspire to other places in public life.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, as all witnesses agree, Judge Lewis and Clerk Ferguson were given
    to drinking habits, which brought them under accusation before the courts for
    drunkenness. It was probable that they would have been convicted; but without
    awaiting the tardiness of the law, a shorter process was found.</p>
    <p>In palliation of their hasty banishment it is claimed that anonymous letters were
    sent to some of the leading white citizens, warning them to leave the county. These
    letters it is asserted&mdash;not proved&mdash;must have proceeded from Clerk
    Ferguson's office, although not written by himself. The object was to intimidate
    those who would be most efficient in convicting and deposing the unworthy
    officials.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, there are two opposing factions of colored Baptists at Marion, and it
    is surmised that one of these factions, regarding these prominent characters as their
    enemies, had something to do with the letter-writing in order to bring down wrath
    upon them. Still another theory is, that the whites have only been awaiting their
    chance, and taking advantage of favorable conditions, knew when and whence the said
    letters would be issued. It was all arranged beforehand. At all events, the time was
    very short, after the delivery of the letters, until Winchester rifles and shot-guns
    were in the hands of some scores of white citizens, and fifteen Negro men, including
    Lewis and Ferguson, York Byers, a deputy sheriff and well-to-do farmer, Dr. Stith, a
    successful young physician, and others, were speedily sent across the river to
    Memphis.</p>
    <p>Clerk Ferguson found himself surrounded by a squad of these brave <a
    name="page278" id="page278"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 278]</span> men, who, with
    rifles presented, demanded that he sign without ceremony a resignation. He signed.
    Byers escaped through the swamps, made his way to the river, and came to Memphis in a
    sorry plight. The other victims were put upon the train with orders to go and never
    return. Byers was to be violently dealt with, had they caught him.</p>
    <p>Sandy S. Odom, living on his farm about six miles from Marion, I am informed,
    refused to leave his home, when waited upon and ordered to go. Said he. "All I have
    is here&mdash;wife, child and farm&mdash;I can't go away." For a time his pluck
    seemed to be respected. His fault was that of being a friend of the Marion officials.
    He had once served at Little Rock as a legislator from his district, but, like
    Cincinnatus, had since resumed the plow.</p>
    <p>According to the latest by the Memphis <i>Appeal</i>, Odom has decided that
    discretion is the better part of valor, and will be off for a safer place as soon as
    his business affairs can be arranged.</p>
    <p>The Governor of Arkansas has refused to interfere, because the Circuit Court Judge
    at Marion has solemnly charged the grand jury as to their duty toward the writers of
    threatening letters, and also toward those who unlawfully drove citizens from their
    homes, etc. But this solemn part of the proceeding was enacted, in spite of the fact
    that the sheriff of Crittenden County was one of the leading spirits in the outrage
    upon the defenceless black men, and the judge and grand jury and all Crittendon
    County are far from expecting to hear of any white man being arrested.</p>
    <p>But last Sunday, Dr. Stith, one of the exiles, went back to Marion on the morning
    train. He had heard that his wife was sick, and he said: "If I am a man I must go to
    her." He was promptly arrested by the patrol force at Marion and lodged in jail,
    where he is likely to remain until next January meeting of court before he can have a
    trial. There is nothing brought against him aside from his having been once
    associated with the "offensive partisans." He had at one time been an active
    politician, but more recently has devoted himself to his profession, and was already
    known as a successful physician. Like Odom, his character is not assailed: but he was
    educated, and influential among the people.</p>
    <p>Two young ladies, teachers from Memphis, one of whom had taught last year at
    Marion, went thither soon after Dr. Stith's arrest, to make inquiry about a situation
    for teaching.</p>
    <p>They were closely watched, and in an interview were warned by a reporter of the
    Memphis <i>Appeal</i> that it was not safe for them to remain in Marion. They had
    reason to think that they were being watched as spies in the interest of the
    banished; hence their stay was very brief.</p>
    <p>When the Clerk Ferguson had vacated, a "white citizen" was at once put into that
    office. It is a remarkable fact that, aside from a few hints about the necessity of
    maintaining order and proceeding according to law, the general tone of the press here
    is to the effect that this occurrence, though unfortunate on account of its effect at
    the North, was really justifiable.</p>
    <a name="page279" id="page279"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 279]</span>
    <p>The cruel wrong inflicted upon those who have no crime laid to their charge, no
    personal reproach of character, is treated as though it were but little more than a
    joke. If the two officials were guilty of drunkenness no one doubts that they could
    have been legally removed from office. If the colored people at Marion are divided
    into factions, then the whites could the more easily combine forces against the
    officials in question, or any political ring which may have existed. But there was a
    general Negro uprising threatened, and in order to save their own lives the whites
    made haste to get into the field first. This is the avowed excuse. But it is certain
    that no one believes there was serious danger of a Negro uprising. The men arrested
    and banished were unarmed, and taken by surprise. If they were in any sense desperate
    or dangerous characters they turned cowards suddenly, making no resistance. Indeed,
    there is but one excuse for their bloodless surrender. They display to the world the
    utter groundlessness of the charge of a conspiracy. No dynamite bombs, no loaded
    weapons, no evidence of organized bands were discovered.</p>
    <p>In all the history of the shot-gun policy and the unnumbered outrages committed,
    there are on record few, if any, cases of conspiracy against life and property on the
    part of the Negro. But the true animus of the Crittenden County affair, I think, is
    found in the current declaration which is used at Marion on the part of the brave men
    who drove out these exiles, viz.: "We don't want any educated niggers, and won't have
    'em here, not even to teach school."</p>
    <p>It should not be overlooked, that in this instance there is fully revealed that
    singular idea which so widely prevails at the South, viz.: A Negro is in his place
    only and always as a subordinate. It is assumed that to educate him unfits him for
    his mission in life, unless that education looks simply to some hand service.</p>
    <p>With this fact before us, we can explain the dead silence of the pulpit and the
    press of the South as touching the first principles of justice.</p>
    <p>The end justifies the means when "Negro rule" is to be prevented, and to protest
    against this bold subversion of the great principles of citizenship in the Republic,
    is to "wave the bloody shirt." We will admit that it is by no means desirable that a
    mass of illiterate people should hold sway, but we claim that the Southern white
    people can break the "color line" if they will, by admitting frankly the rights of
    the Negro, and by encouraging him to aspire to an intelligent and worthy manhood.</p>

    <h3>EXTRACTS.</h3>
    <p>Fifty years ago there was a boy in Africa who was taken prisoner in one of the
    fierce wars between the tribes, and was carried away from his home to be sold as a
    slave. First he was sold for a horse. Then his buyer thought him a bad exchange for
    the horse, and compelled his master to take him back. <a name="page280"
    id="page280"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 280]</span> Then he was sold for so much
    rum. This was called another bad bargain by the man who had bought him, and again he
    was returned, to be sold for tobacco with the same result. Nobody wanted the poor,
    miserable slave-boy, who was on the point of committing suicide when he was bought by
    a Portuguese trader and carried away in a slave ship. How little that wretched boy
    knew what the future had in store for him as he lay chained in the hold of the
    crowded slave-ship! But one of England's war ships that were clearing the high seas
    of the slavers bore down upon the Portuguese vessel, rescued the captives, and the
    African boy was placed under Christian influences, baptized and educated, and to-day
    he is Bishop Crowther, England's black Bishop in Africa.&mdash;<i>The Gospel in all

    <p>A very obliging Indian.&mdash;Dr. C.A. White, Professor of Paleontology in the
    Smithsonian Institution, relates this pleasing incident. Being in the Ute country a
    year or so ago, in pursuit of scientific facts, he found himself on one occasion
    encamped some fifty miles from Uintah Agency. Being desirous of sending a letter to
    his wife in Washington, he entrusted it to an Indian who, he learned by signs, was on
    his way to the agency. He was not sure that the Indian understood what he desired him
    to do with the letter, but took the risk of that. His wife received the letter and
    was surprised at finding it postmarked Salt Lake City. The Doctor afterward learned
    that the Indian arrived at the agency just after the mail had gone, and knowing that
    it would be a month before another mail would be sent out he actually carried the
    letter to Salt Lake City, a distance of 225 miles, for this white man whom he had
    never met before, and whose name he did not know. Doubtless the Indian thought the
    letter of great importance, but where is the white man who would have done as much
    for his best friend, without the hope of reward or even thanks?&mdash;<i>Council

    <h3>SCHOOL ECHOES.</h3>
    <p>In 1864 in Memphis, in a refugee school that I visited while chaplain in the army,
    the Bible lesson was John xv., "I am the vine and my father is the husbandman." One
    little fellow recited it thus: "I am the vine and my father is a married man."</p>
    <p>What for we come to this school.&mdash;We come for to intelligent about the
    civilization ways, and we want to American write, we want to American home, and we
    want friendly each other with the white people. We are commence learning discretion
    and we are works our own hands. My conscience has cried because our Indian they can
    not do nothing with their hands and when I look back our old Indian ways I am great
    sorry, but when I looked future I have examined with careful attention, and I very
    great pleasure. Last summer I went home. I worked at harness, but I don't <a

    <h3>ROME AND THE FREEDMEN.</h3>
    <p>We present below two articles on this subject. The first is from a London paper
    and the second is from one of the many able papers edited by colored men. As to the
    facts alleged we have no definite information. When the slaves were emancipated the
    Roman Catholics made very decided efforts to win them. It was supposed by Protestants
    that the grand ceremonials, the gaudy vestments, the music, and especially the
    welcome which the Papal Church was said to give to all men irrespective of riches,
    race or color, would attract the Freedmen. But the expectation was not met; the
    Freedmen were not attracted, and soon the special efforts seemed to cease. But Rome
    never surrenders, and those efforts may now be resumed. We invite attention to the
    two articles.</p>
    <h4>From "THE CHRISTIAN."</h4>
    <p>Romanism is spreading among the colored people of the American Continent, and it
    is said that several Negroes are now in training in Rome and elsewhere to become
    priests. The American Roman Catholic papers say that the cause is not far to seek,
    the Roman Catholic Church being 'the only one on this continent offering the Negro
    communion on terms of equality.' If this is not true all round, it certainly is the
    fact that outbreaks of the so-called 'color-prejudice' have been of but rare
    occurrence among the Romanists, and that they are apparently reaping the result in a
    large accession of numbers.</p>
    <h4>From "THE NEGRO AMERICAN."</h4>
    <p>Few persons are aware of the rapid spread of Catholicism among the colored people
    of this country. From the <i>American Catholic Tribune</i>, the organ of the colored
    Catholics of America, we obtain facts that are truly startling. Young colored men are
    now in Rome and in the Catholic schools and colleges of the United States, preparing
    for work among their people in America, and Africa as well, while to-day missionaries
    are everywhere busy, sowing the seeds of Catholic belief and worship. These teachings
    are eagerly accepted by the colored people. The cause of this success among them is
    not far to seek. The Catholic Church, of all which are ruled by whites on this
    continent, is the only one offering the Negro communion on terms of equality. While
    the Southern Protestants are setting up separate synods, councils, presbyteries and
    conferences for the Negro, and the Y.M.C.A., with the same narrow spirit, is refusing
    colored men seats in its councils, while Northern Protestants are either neutral in
    this matter of caste or only half-hearted <a name="page282" id="page282"></a><span
    class="newpage">[pg 282]</span> in crying down upon the sin of it; the Catholics
    alone have accepted in a full and liberal sense the command, "preach my gospel to
    every creature," and have extended fellowship to all, regardless of race, color or
    condition. It matters not what their motive is. The fact stands boldly out. True,
    instances are occurring of outbreaks of color-prejudice among the Catholics, but the
    policy of the church is openly and boldly against discrimination of whatever sort
    among its members. The fear of "social equality," that shadow of a something that
    never did, and never can, exist, that bug-bear of illiberal minds and narrow culture,
    does not stand guard at the doors of this church to drive away the colored worshipper
    or compel him to sit at the second table at the Lord's feast. Is it to be wondered
    at, then, that the colored people are flocking to the Catholic fold? This they will
    continue to do, so long as the spirit of caste dictates the policy, and governs the
    action, of the white Protestants of the United States.</p>

    <h2>THE SOUTH.</h2>
    <h3>VACATION ECHOES.</h3>
    <center>
      REV. G.S. ROLLINS.
    </center>
    <p>I wish some of our home friends who complain of dull, unprofitable prayer-meetings
    could step into one of the kind we have in our colored churches. One soon loses sight
    of mispronunciation and wretched grammar in listening to the sensible, meaty,
    forceful ideas which many of these negroes can express. You cannot go to a
    prayer-meeting without bringing something away.</p>
    <p>One good old mother in Israel said to me lately, in regard to the weekly
    prayer-meeting: "I begins in de mawnin' to lay my plans fur dat meetin', an I don
    stop ter eat so's to get my work along froo de day. And I tinks and prays a heap
    about dat meetin' all day, I does."</p>
    <p>How many of you at home do as much for your prayer-meeting as this poor old
    colored woman? No dull summer prayer-meetings when church members go prepared like
    this. I have said that these people have ideas and can express them. At my last
    prayer-meeting before departing for my vacation, one good brother prayed that the
    "Lord would bless the pastor in his absence and continue to fill him up with new
    things, so he can give them out to us." The pastor is filling up as fast as
    possible.</p>
    <p>One of the questions most often asked is, "Are the colored people improving?" One
    has to say, "Of course they are." But are they progressing rapidly? Yes and no. Yes,
    considering their antecedents and present advantages. No, if one were to measure
    their rate of progress by our impatience. The surest progress is not the swiftest.
    Slow and sure is the rule by which we work. Statistics but feebly tell the story of
    the improvement <a name="page283" id="page283"></a><span class="newpage">[pg
    283]</span> of the Freedmen since the war. They can best testify concerning the
    advance who have been in the field since the beginning of the work.</p>
    <p>But even if it is slow, it pays well. There came into my church one Sunday not
    long ago a poor old lady who was a comparative stranger in the city. During the
    sermon she sat with mouth, eyes and ears open. After the service she came to me and
    said, "I tank de Lord He bro't me year. I done been gwine ter church dese fifty
    years, an I nebber heard de tex 'splained befo." This old lady has since united with
    our church, and when she is not there I know something serious is the matter at her
    home. It is worth a year's preaching to have the privilege of enlightening one
    benighted soul like this.</p>
    <p>I called recently on an old gentleman who had become generally disgusted with
    "dese yere churches roun year." I found him poring over a big, well-worn Bible, the
    perspiration pouring down his shiny face, and with a big pair of spectacles resting
    on the tip of his nose. With an air of superior wisdom he surveyed me over the top of
    the spectacles, and then solemnly stated to the few who gathered around as I sat down
    on an old soap box, "Dat a preacher? I kin tell a preacher the fus question I ask
    him." Then taking off the spectacles and slowly closing the big Bible, he went on:
    "Now I'se gwine to put you all a question" (looking at the others) "an den I'se gwine
    ter ask de preacher, an I can tell whedder he'm a good one or not." "Now," said he,
    "when we gits cold and wicked follerin' our own ways, how does de Lord brung us back
    again to our senses?" This question was put with various modifications to each in
    turn until it came to me. "Now, what does you say?" he said to me. I replied that my
    experience said "Trouble." "Yah! Yah! dat's it, Trouble. You's answered it, shore;
    dese yere ignorant niggers, dey don't know nuffin. Ise gwine up to hear you preach
    next Sunday." And sure enough, there he was the next Sunday and his wife with him.
    This is about the way we gather them in, one by one.</p>
    <p>A great many families are gathered in by getting their children interested. A
    parent sends his little ones to our school and says: "I never had no chance to git
    learnin', but I wants my children to have it."</p>
    <p>There, after all this rambling, I have reached the one idea which I believe ought
    to stick in the mind of every A.M.A. worker and every A.M.A. supporter&mdash;the
    children! If we can only teach them, save them, the African in America and in Africa
    is saved. It seems to me this is the solution of the problem. The longer one labors
    among the colored people and learns them and their surroundings, the more difficult
    seems the solution of the negro problem. Tourists in the South and people at a
    distance are very prolific in suggestions as to the best methods for elevating the
    negro. Why! visitors who have spent hardly twenty-four hours in a Southern city can
    write home marvellous letters as to the wonderful progress of the colored race, and
    prophesy a speedy settlement of the matter of negro education and race prejudice. It
    is a fact, however, that the longer one stays here the more <a name="page284"
    id="page284"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 284]</span> puzzled he grows about these
    matters. An old A.M.A. worker said to me, "The first year of your work you will think
    you understand the colored people pretty well; the second year you won't know quite
    so much; the third year still less, and so on until by the tenth year you will think
    you don't know anything about them." But we all come to one conclusion, that all the
    trouble arising from race prejudice will pass away as the negro rises. When he is
    able to intelligently exercise all his rights, then the white man will <i>have to
    acknowledge them</i>. This result is in the distance, and while due attention is
    given to the older ones, yet the destiny of the colored race is wrapt up in the
    rising generation. They are terribly endangered, but they must be saved if the race
    is saved. A new generation, who knew nothing of slavery but much of the dangers of
    freedom, are taking hold upon manhood. They must be taught to read, to think, to
    work, to save and to love goodness for its own sake. If all this can be brought about
    I believe the Negro question will be settled. This <i>must</i> be done. I trust that
    not all of the 1,500 who have lately signified a willingness to enter the mission
    field will suppose that all of the ignorant and needy millions are on the other side
    of the globe. We hear a good deal just now about patriotism. Now, how can one better
    prove his patriotism than by giving his money or service to save his country from
    ignorance and degradation? It will pay you back in dollars and cents, to say nothing
    of the reward of learning that "it is more blessed to give than to receive."</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>INTEMPERANCE.</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The few lines below indicate the quality and flavor of the papers read by the
      graduating class at Atlanta University.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>One of the great causes of intemperance in our land is that lack of self-respect
    which the present state of society induces among the poor and laborious. Just as long
    as wealth is the object of worship and the measure of men's importance, and is
    regarded as the badge of distinction, just so long will there be a tendency toward
    self-abasement and self-abandonment among those whose lot gives them no chance to
    acquire it.</p>
    <p>Such naturally feel as if the great good of life were denied them. They feel
    themselves neglected. Their condition cuts them off from communion with educated and
    refined people. They think they have little or no stake in the general weal of life.
    They feel as though they have no character to lose, consequently intemperance takes
    possession of them.</p>
    <p>This evil of intemperence is said by some to be the greatest of all evils. It is
    the cause of the ruin of some of our fathers and brothers, and I am sorry to say it
    ruins some of the mothers. When we, the temperance girls and boys, ask them to leave
    off their habit of drinking, they tell us that it does them good. When cold it makes
    them warm, when warm it makes <a name="page285" id="page285"></a><span
    class="newpage">[pg 285]</span> them cold. When troubled, it cheers them. When weak,
    it strengthens them. It is certainly killing them by degrees.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>STUDENT'S LETTER.</h3>
    <h4>THE BLUE-JACKET TEACHER&mdash;FIRST SCHOOL EXPERIENCE.</h4>
    <p>From youth I was impressed that the "Yankee" was the terror of the world, capable
    of literally swallowing a small fellow, so it was with great difficulty that Judge
    M.J. S&mdash;&mdash;, a Southern white man, induced me, in 1873, to enter Burrell
    Academy, then an A.M.A. school located in Selma, Alabama, and taught by some of those
    "blue jacket" beings whose names did not always begin with "blessed." The principal
    having sent me to Grade 2, I followed a little girl to the door of that room. She
    passed in while I stood at the door and thought thus, "Shall I go in here when one of
    those awful "blues" is there?" Half doubting, half fearing, trembling throughout, I
    slipped shyly inside the first school-house I ever entered, and lo! to my greatest
    surprise there sat a woman who was anything but "blue," whose face was as white and
    fair as any ever seen, whose hair was slightly golden, whose voice seemed more sweet,
    mellow and musical than the softest flute note; she was one whom all praised and
    loved. The only blue about her was her eyes, which marked her pure Saxon lineage.</p>
    <p>When I felt sure that no monster would suddenly spring from those queer walls of
    white and black, I silently exclaimed, "Why, that's a white woman!"</p>
    <p>In March, 1873, she began teaching me the alphabet, when I was thirteen years old.
    I had no mother and no home or friend, other than Judge S&mdash;&mdash;, in whose
    family I served.</p>
    <p>In 1874 he left the city, leaving me homeless. I vainly sought work but was turned
    away with "too small."</p>
    <p>Pinched and pressed by hunger and want, I was despairing when that angel-like
    teacher, one of the purest and best of women, came to my rescue, and thenceforth with
    her own hands and earnings continued to help supply all my needs&mdash;material and
    spiritual. She taught me the alphabet of school, of life and of heaven; she
    influenced me to pray, and in answer to our prayers I was converted and joined the
    church in 1875.</p>
    <p>In May, 1879, finishing the course, I graduated from Grammar Department A, of
    Burrell Academy, and began teaching in Cato, Miss., in 1880. In the autumn of this
    year, I entered the Normal and College Preparatory Departments of Talladega College,
    and graduated in May, 1884.</p>
    <p>Returning to Preston, Ga., I resumed my school work, whence I was called to a
    position in Burrell Academy under Prof. Edwin C. Silsby, Principal. <a name="page286"
    id="page286"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 286]</span> Upon the resignation of the
    above named gentleman, in 1885, I was finally chosen principal of that school. This
    position I still hold, striving to perform in the most faithful, earnest and
    satisfactory manner the work of him that sent me.</p>
    <p>The first money earned by me as teacher, went toward the purchase of the home now
    owned and occupied by us. My good friend, who labors to-day in Beaufort, N.C., having
    helped me through college and seen me launch upon life's tide, seemed to say, "My
    boy, do not <i>drift</i>, but <i>steer</i> straight for heaven's port, and do unto
    others as I have done unto you." For me, her prayers still ascend, unto me, her wise
    counsel still comes, and upon me, her benedictions still rest.</p>
    <p>In conclusion I say God bless you, A.M.A. for sending such a laborer into the
    field, for if there is, or shall be, in me anything of manhood, worth or useful
    service to my country, my people and my God, the credit is due to her.</p>

    <h2>THE INDIANS.</h2>
    <h3>MR. MOODY'S MISSIONARY MEETINGS.</h3>
    <center>
      REV. MR. SHELTON'S ADDRESS
    </center>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Mr. Moody's Missionary Meetings have been a marvel in their conception, in their
      remarkably large audiences and in the still more remarkably able and interesting
      class of speakers&mdash;some of them from distant mission fields. They show how
      broad and many-sided is Mr. Moody's mind and heart.</p>
      <p>At the meeting held August 8th, Rev. C.W. Shelton, the Financial Secretary for
      Indian Missions of the American Missionary Association, was invited to address the
      meeting. We condense from the <i>Springfield Union</i> an outline of Mr. Shelton's
      stirring address, and its effect upon Mr. Moody and others in attendance, with the
      practical results.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The most stirring address of the morning was delivered by Rev. Chas. W. Shelton of
    New York City, on the Indian problem. He stated the problem with simplicity and
    dignity, but when he got worked into his theme, he became eloquent in his description
    of the position of the Indian people and their strong desire to receive the gospel.
    While he was illustrating his argument with pathetic incidents in his experience,
    there were many of his audience in tears.</p>
    <p>The speaker described the Indians themselves; their first characteristic was the
    deep religious nature which swayed their whole life. They prayed oftener and more
    fervently than Christians, worshipping everything that was unknown and mysterious; of
    which the saddest thing was that the Indian's gods were all gods of anger, involving
    sacrifices. To show the extent to which the Indians would sacrifice themselves to
    appease their god's anger, a very touching story was told of a boy torturing himself
    for the recovery <a name="page287" id="page287"></a><span class="newpage">[pg
    287]</span> of his sick mother. At the close of the Mohonk Conference, two years ago,
    our committee went to President Cleveland to petition in regard to methods. He said
    that he sympathized with all our methods and ideas. "But," he said, "gentlemen, you
    may do all you can at Mohonk, I may do all I can here in the White House, and
    Congress may do all that they can over there, but," and he turned and picked up a
    Bible, "gentlemen, after all, that book has got to settle the Indian problem."
    (Applause.) And the President was right. Before you can do anything for the
    preservation of the Indian you've got to give him a new hope, a new salvation. I have
    studied many tribes, and have never found a tribe or village of Indians or a single
    Indian civilized before he was Christianized.</p>
    <p>The speaker next considered the question whether the Christianization of the
    Indians was possible. This he answered by the case of the 400 Indians taken captive
    in the Sioux war which followed the Minnesota massacre of 1862. In the fall of that
    year, a missionary went to their prison, and in the next six months taught 392 to
    read and established a church with 295 members. Subsequently President Lincoln
    pardoned all but 39 and the survivors went among the Sioux, and the speaker
    considered the ten Christian churches and 2,000 Christians among the 40,000 Sioux to
    be owing to this church of prisoners. In Dakota, every one of the 40,000 Indians was
    ready to receive the gospel.</p>
    <p>On Mr. Moody's asking how much he wanted, he said that it took $400 to start a
    station, and $300 a year to keep it up. He then related a very pathetic story of an
    old Indian who traveled 150 miles across the Territory seven times to get a
    missionary sent among his people. The difficulty in getting one arose from the
    society sending the missionaries, whose debt was so large that the executive board
    had refused to send out any more. ("Board wants more faith," put in Mr. Moody.) The
    old man finally went back to his people, saying sadly: "They must die in their
    darkness; the Christian people of America haven't interest enough in the poor dying
    Indian to try and help him."</p>
    <p>Mr. Moody, who had been apparently deep in thought ever since the speaker had
    mentioned the sum necessary to start a station, now broke out, "Got a mission started
    where that old man wanted it?" in such an earnest way that it brought down the house.
    But Mr. Moody wasn't satisfied till Mr. Shelton answered in the affirmative, and
    added that what he said of the Sioux was true of the other tribes, 68 of whom were
    untouched by any missionary efforts. At this point, $300 was handed to the platform
    to establish a station, and the audience grew enthusiastic. The speaker continued,
    illustrating the need of Christian work among the Indians and their willingness to
    receive it by telling a story of a little Indian girl who was converted while dying.
    She asked of her teacher: "But, lady, how long have you known of this beautiful
    story?" "Many years," replied the missionary. "And how long has white man known of
    this?" "Oh, very many years." <a name="page288" id="page288"></a><span

    heaven so long, what for, why has he not told poor dying Indian about this before? If
    I could only get well, I would go and tell all my people this beautiful story about
    Jesus and home," and with those words, "Jesus and home," her eyes closed forever.</p>
    <p>In answer to Mr. Moody's questions, he described the stations, little buildings of
    three rooms, and the missionaries' life, at home, and teaching the Indians to
    cultivate the soil, as well as preaching to them; his wife also teaching the women.
    The audience had become quite enthusiastic by the time he finished his eloquent
    appeal, and at this moment Mr. Sankey offered $700 to start one station, and shortly
    after Mr. Moody pledged an equal amount. A lady then handed in $400 to go with the
    $300 subscribed during the address. Mr. Moody himself then made a brief appeal,
    speaking of the Indian boys and girls in his school and the high rank they had taken.
    He offered a short prayer and then dismissed the audience, telling Mr. Shelton to
    "make himself plenty" around the buildings during the afternoon, and doubtless he
    would receive more money.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Mr. Shelton did "make himself plenty" around the building, and the result has
      been that nearly $3,000 were contributed either in cash or in pledges that have
      since been redeemed. Still other contributions are anticipated as the outcome of
      this fine address. Three out-stations will be started at once in Dakota, one of
      them bearing the name of Mr. Moody, another of Mr. Sankey, and the third may be
      named Northfield or it may bear the name designated by the donor.</p>

    <h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>
    <h3>CONFUCIUS AND CHRIST&mdash;A LETTER FROM HONG SING.</h3>
    <p>It would be presumptious, I fear, for me to assume that the readers of the
    <i>Missionary</i> remember the little sketch I gave some years ago of one of our
    missionary helpers&mdash;Hong Sing. A very little man he is, in "bodily presence
    weak" and in speech, for lack of lungs, sometimes "of no account." Yet, though
    near-sighted almost to blindness, and though often sick and always weary, in the
    intervals of work as a house-servant he gained what seemed to me a remarkable
    knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. The Bible was (and still <i>is</i>, I doubt
    not) his unfailing companion, and its study his choicest rest.</p>
    <p>Several years ago, his health became so precarious that he decided to return to
    his native land. A letter from him, under date of "San Ning District, July 9th,
    1888," has interested me so much that I feel sure that others will enjoy the reading
    of it. His English needs straightening somewhat, for, while the words are ours, the
    idioms are sometimes decidedly Chinese. I confess, therefore, to having done a little
    correcting and even <a name="page289" id="page289"></a><span class="newpage">[pg
    289]</span> translating, yet, for the most part, the letter is just as our brother
    himself wrote it.</p>
    <p>"<i>Mr. Pond</i>:&mdash;Dear Brother, I must tell you that I think of you many
    times and intended to write you many times, but some things prevented me. I go out to
    tell the old, old story of Jesus, and many questions have been asked. I am not able
    to write all, but I tell you a little. Some ask: 'Do you believe our Confucius?' I
    said, 'I do.' 'Don't you think his doctrine good?' I answer, 'Yes.' 'What was the
    matter, you believe in Jesus, the foreign doctrine, and why not for our Confucius;
    and what was the matter, you are entirely turned away from his doctrine and not obey
    him; you think his doctrine not good enough for you! He has taught us to worship the
    ancestors and also use a lamb for sacrifice, why don't you obey?'</p>
    <p>"<i>Ques</i>.&mdash;'Your Jesus men, was there any difference between them and
    us?'</p>
    <p>"<i>Ans</i>.&mdash;'No difference, our Jesus men wear hat just like your hat, wear
    clothes like your clothes, walk just like you walk, but only one thing was not like
    you&mdash;<i>in worship</i>. You all worship the idol, our Jesus men worship the true
    God who is in heaven, and you all worship with meat and fruit, etc., but we mean to
    worship with true heart. We believe Jesus <i>that we may obey Confucius doctrine</i>,
    in which he has taught us to be good. Those who are not Christians cannot obey what
    Confucius taught. Before I became a Christian I was swearing and I speak evil words,
    but since I believe in Jesus, these things I was entirely stopped of. I remember
    Confucius has written in his book, teaching us to be honest, and also say, vice
    things we must not look at, the vice way we must not walk, the vice word we must
    neither speak nor hear. How rarely I hear of a man who believes Confucius and does
    what he taught. They are swearing all the time, speak the evil word all the time, go
    among the bad women all the time. So this attests that they do not obey Confucius,
    but disobey and dishonor him. Once we do like the same, but since we found Jesus and
    believe he is our Saviour, we stop to speak the bad word, stopped to gamble and smoke
    opium. Very seldom I hear or see those who study Confucius do as the Jesus men, for
    these are they that obey Confucius doctrine and keep his word. Why cannot those
    disciples of Confucius be better men? Ah, Confucius only a good man, he can only tell
    you the way how to be good man, but he has no power to change your heart, and Jesus
    can if we trust in him. This <i>I know</i>, for before I found Jesus I was always
    swearing and use the bad language, but since I believe in Jesus and confess my sins
    and ask him to forgive, I <i>know</i> that he has helped me to keep away from all
    vice and has converted my heart that I might be a better man. Therefore our Confucius
    was a man, but Jesus is God.'</p>
    <p>"Another question they asked me: 'You say, whenever you pray to God, God is there.
    Suppose you go to the stable to pray, do you think God was there&mdash;such a dirty
    place&mdash;and hear your prayer?' I answer, 'Yes, for God is everywhere. And though
    we call the place a dirty place, the heart that <a name="page290"
    id="page290"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 290]</span> prays may be clean. You see
    the sun rise in the sky, its beams shine over all the world; God's eye the same, not
    only see over the world but all through our hearts.'</p>
    <p>"Mr. Hager (Missionary of the American Board in South China) has opened a school
    in our district, so that I found a good opportunity to speak in the name of Jesus.
    The seed was sown into their ears, but I do not know what the hardest will be."</p>
    <p>I have also received a brief but interesting note from another of our former
    helpers&mdash;Wong Ock&mdash;a man of great fervency of spirit and a diligent student
    of the Word. Years ago he joined the Salvation Army and was sent to London to be
    trained for Army work in China. We had lost sight of him, till this letter came.
    Though not connected with the Army he is busy in Christian work, preaching in one of
    the Gospel Halls in Hong Kong under direction of Dr. Ernest J. Eitel. For some time
    before he left California he declined to receive any salary as a helper, believing
    that the Lord would provide, and he is working still upon this principle, and not
    without fruit. A note from Dr. Eitel speaks of one of Wong Ock's hearers offering
    himself for baptism, though the work had been in operation but three weeks.</p>
    <p>In anticipation of the confirmation of the new treaty, the Chinese are crowding
    upon us in larger numbers than at any time before for several years. By hook or by
    crook they get in, finding no lack of American lawyers ready to smooth their way, and
    when one opening in the Restriction Act is closed to seek or make another. If
    well-supported rumors are to be believed, even customs-officials have not always been
    irresponsive to golden arguments. At any rate they come, and the Central School in
    this city is crowded with pupils, the average attendance for last month being 113,
    and the number present often rising to 130 or 140. We are glad to welcome them,
    though with our present force of teachers&mdash;which lack of means forbids us to
    increase&mdash;the pressure for instruction in English interferes more or less with
    that gospel teaching which it is our chief aim and our sufficient reward to impart.
    Yet an earnest spirit pervades the school, and, indeed in almost all our missions the
    outlook for harvest seems to me more hopeful than ever before.</p>

    <h3>A SKETCH OF MISSION LIFE ON THE FRONTIER.</h3>
    <p>FORT YATES, DAK.</p>
    <p>I am alone once more, all my company have gone. The plasterer has just been here
    and I had to dismantle my house entirely for him; I am therefore too tired to write.
    I have been putting up bulberry jelly and am trying to get ready for my company,
    which will come the first of September and stay until we all go together down to Oahe
    to the meeting.</p>
    <p>I feel that aside from the pleasure so much company gives me it will help our
    work. This is the station farthest out in the wilderness, and now that people know
    that soon the "native wild man" will be no more, they all want to see him. I have two
    beds. When ladies come they fill the bedrooms, and so if <i>distinguished</i>
    gentlemen come. I sleep either in the kitchen or laundry on a blanket or robes.
    Several times this year my bedrooms have both been full and I have made "down" beds
    on my sitting-room floor for from two to six gentlemen. As I only have four very
    small rooms, the kitchen floor is often covered, too, with beds. My table is an
    extension table and my heart is an extension heart, but alas for my dishes and
    silver! When Prof. W&mdash;&mdash; of Oberlin was here the dishes would not go 'round
    and had to be pieced out; but, after all, the guests have the best I can give them
    and have it freely, and I gladly give them my services, and they seem to enjoy
    it.</p>
    <p>I put up a log house for a work room and laundry; I helped an Indian boy to make a
    shutter to the door and window and I did all the dividing and helped lift the logs,
    and we put up a pretty good room, and it only cost me twenty dollars, I believe; and
    O! what would I have done without it, with my big washings and ironings and
    inexperienced Indian woman to work! I secured a little lime from the plasterer and I
    am going to try to whitewash inside with a <i>broom</i>&mdash;I have no brush. The
    Indians all came home without signing either paper for the Commissioners. They will
    not sell their land. I am very sorry, for I think it the best thing for them.</p>

    <p><b>LAUDES DOMINI.</b></p>
    <p>This latest of Dr. Chas. S Robinson's famous hymn and tune books has already been
    adopted by hundreds of churches. Choirs and congregations are charmed with the
    richness and great variety of its music.</p>
    <p><b>SPIRITUAL SONGS FOR CHURCH AND CHOIR.</b></p>
    <p>Is used with satisfaction in thousands of churches. It is preferred by those who
    enjoy selections from the better class of what is commonly called popular music. It
    is less expensive than "LAUDES DOMINI," and there is a cheap edition of it without
    music.</p>
    <p><b>ABRIDGED EDITION LAUDES DOMINI.</b></p>
    <p>A complete book for churches which prefer a more limited selection of hymns and
    tunes. It is also well adapted to use in colleges, or in the prayer-meetings of
    churches possessing a fair amount of musical ability.</p>
    <p><b>SPIRITUAL SONGS FOR SOCIAL WORSHIP.</b></p>
    <p>More than 200,000 copies of this popular prayer-meeting hymn and tune book have
    been sold. It never fails to give satisfaction.</p>
    <p>An edition is now ready, bound in boards, with tunes, only FORTY CENTS PER COPY.
    And a "words only" edition, in paper covers, at TEN CENTS PER COPY.</p>
    <p><b>FOR THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL.</b></p>
    <p>A new selection by Dr. Chas. S. Robinson will soon be ready, which will doubtless

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
